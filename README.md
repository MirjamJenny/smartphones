Course project for Getting and Cleaning Data

This repository includes the files:
  run_analysis.R that runs the required analysis and produces the two data set,
  CodeBook.Rmd that describes the resulting data, and
  smartphonesFinal.Rdata (the resulting final dataset).
  
  The code gets the right variables into a workable format after loading the data and then computes the means for the variables in question. Finally, it produces the data as a text file and as an R-data file.
